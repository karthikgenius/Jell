# Jell
Jell, a reverse shell that make victim's machine to connect to your machine. Have a Jell!
My first Repo.
Entirely programmed in python3.
The file names in the repo speaks out where they have to be executed, run them accordingly.
As this was my first application that programmed from scratch, I will be always available for you to report any error regarding the stuff
resident in the repo.
